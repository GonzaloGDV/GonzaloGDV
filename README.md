# Hi, I'm Gonzalo! ðŸ‘‹

I have just graduated as Full-Stack developer from _Soy Henry_. During Henry's bootcamp, I have learned JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, Redux, HTML, CSS, Sequelize, Git and SQL. I am currently looking for my first tech job. I would love to work in a company where I could apply my knowledge and new learned skills. I have business background with a Bachelor in Administration from _Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Argentina_.
